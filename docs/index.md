# Operaton Robot Playground

Welcome to this opinionated documentation for documentation for orchestrating [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) test or task suites with [Operaton](https://operaton.org/) BPM engine. The documentation was introduced for a workshop at [RoboCon.io](https://robocon.io/) Helsinki 2025.

This documentation accompanies a playground, which you can open in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/datakurre/operaton-robot-playground).

## Preparations

The workshop playground has been tested with GitHub Codespaces, but with some effort, you can also run it locally. Check [Getting Started](https://github.com/datakurre/operaton-robot-playground#getting-started) at [the playground repository](https://github.com/datakurre/operation-robot-playground) for instructions on how to get the playground environment up and running.
