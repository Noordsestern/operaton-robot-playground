# Operaton Robot Playground

Welcome to this opinionated documentations for documentation for orchestrating [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) test or task suites with [Operaton](https://operaton.org/) BPM engine. The documentation was introduced for a workshop at [RoboCon.io](https://robocon.io/) Helsinki 2025.

This documentation accompanies a playground, which you can open in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/datakurre/operaton-robot-playground).

<!--
Sometime, a sequential pipeline is too limited for automated (test) processes: Distribute Robot Framework workloads by learning the basics of BPMN 2.0 process modeling and discovering how to use executable BPMN models to orchestrate complex end-to-end test suites with Robot Framework, RobotCode, and the related open-source ecosystem.
